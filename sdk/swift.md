| Library | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ZeroByte` | Links, envelopes, the relay, push registration, signal and ICE |
| `ZeroBytePush` | APNs registrations and push payloads, for apps that use Apple push notifications |

## Set up a link

```swift
import ZeroByte

let relayBase = URL(string: "https://relay.example.com/v1/")!
let appID = "019a0d4e-6b1c-7f3a-9c2d-5e8f7a6b4c3d"

let credentials = try Credentials(linkKey: linkKey, linkID: linkID)   // Data (32 bytes), UUID
let relay = Relay(appID: appID, credentials: credentials, base: relayBase)
let link = Link(
    credentials: credentials,
    sends: .primaryToCompanion,          // .companionToPrimary on the other device
    transport: relay,
    lastReceived: store.lastReceived)    // UInt64?, nil on a new link
```

`Credentials(linkKey:linkID:)` throws `ZeroByteError.invalidKey` if the key is not 32 bytes or the
id not 16. The `linkID` may be a `UUID` or 16 bytes of `Data`.

## Send

```swift
let sequence = try await link.send(Data("hello".utf8))
```

`send` is `@discardableResult` and returns the sequence the message was stored under. It throws
`ZeroByteError.tooLarge` above 1 MiB, and `RelayError` for relay failures.

## Receive

```swift
for message in try await link.receive() {
    handle(message.plaintext)          // message.sequence is the UInt64 sequence
}
store.lastReceived = await link.lastReceived
```

`receive()` returns `[(sequence: UInt64, plaintext: Data)]` in order. Save `lastReceived` after you
have handled the messages.

## Watch

```swift
func watch() async {
    var delay: Duration = .seconds(1)
    while !Task.isCancelled {
        let notifications = relay.watch(direction: .companionToPrimary)   // opens the socket
        await pull()                                    // catch up on (re)connect
        for await _ in notifications {
            delay = .seconds(1)
            await pull()
        }
        try? await Task.sleep(for: delay)               // the socket closed: back off
        delay = min(delay * 2, .seconds(60))
    }
}

func pull() async {
    do {
        for message in try await link.receive() { handle(message.plaintext) }
        store.lastReceived = await link.lastReceived
    } catch {
        // network or relay error; the next notification or reconnect retries
    }
}
```

`watch(direction:)` starts the socket and returns an `AsyncStream<UInt64>` of sequence
numbers. The stream ends when the socket closes; cancelling the consuming task closes the socket.
Watch the direction you **read**, the reverse of `sends`. The socket sends `ping` every 30 seconds,
which keeps NATs open and tells a relay with push that this device is awake.

`URLSessionWebSocketTask` does not report the moment the handshake completes, so the stream has no
"open" event. The `pull()` right after starting the watch covers almost everything; an envelope
stored in the short window before the handshake completes is picked up by the next notification.
If your app may sit idle with the socket open and nothing else being sent, also pull on a timer
while watching, for example every few minutes.

Run the watch while the app is active. On iOS, cancel the task when the scene goes to the
background and start it again on `.active`:

```swift
.onChange(of: scenePhase) { _, phase in
    if phase == .active { watchTask = Task { await watch() } }
    else { watchTask?.cancel() }
}
```

## Push

On relays whose app has `push=<topic>`. The reader registers on the direction it reads; the
writer asks for a push per message. See [Push](../protocol/extensions.md#push).

```swift
import ZeroBytePush

// The reader, after didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:
let tag = PushRegistration.randomTag()                 // store it with the link
try await relay.registerPush(
    .apns(deviceToken: token, environment: .production, tag: tag, alert: "New message"),
    direction: .companionToPrimary)

// The writer:
try await link.send(Data("hello".utf8), notify: .alert)
```

The push carries only the tag. In the notification service extension, find the link by
`ZeroBytePushPayload.tag(in: request.content.userInfo)`, call `receive()`, and replace the alert
with the decrypted message. `unregisterPush(direction:)` stops the pushes.

## Signal and ICE

On relays whose app has `signal`: a rendezvous for setting up a direct WebRTC connection. Frames
are sealed under signal keys derived from the link key; the relay cannot read or forge them. See
[Signal](../protocol/extensions.md#signal).

```swift
let channel = relay.signal(sends: .primaryToCompanion)
let ice = try await relay.iceServers()                 // on relays with ICE configured
for await event in await channel.events() {
    switch event {
    case .peer(true): try await channel.send(offer)    // the other device is here
    case .peer(false): break                           // it left
    case .message(let data): handle(data)              // answer, candidates
    }
}
```

## Unpair

```swift
try await link.erase()
try keychain.deleteLink()
store.lastReceived = nil
```

## Store the link key

Keep the link key in the Keychain as a generic password, available after first unlock, on this
device only, not synchronised:

```swift
let query: [String: Any] = [
    kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
    kSecAttrService as String: "com.example.app.zerobyte",
    kSecAttrAccount as String: linkID.uuidString,
    kSecValueData as String: linkKey,
    kSecAttrAccessible as String: kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly,
    kSecAttrSynchronizable as String: false,
]
let status = SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
```

`ThisDeviceOnly` keeps the key out of iCloud Keychain and out of backups restored to another
device. See [Storing the link key](../guides/key-storage.md).

## API reference

### `Credentials`

```swift
public struct Credentials: Sendable, Hashable {
    public init(linkKey: Data, linkID: Data) throws
    public init(linkKey: Data, linkID: UUID) throws
    public let mailboxID: Data            // 16 bytes
    public let accessToken: Data          // 32 bytes
    public var mailboxName: String        // 32 lowercase hex characters
    public var bearerToken: String        // 43 characters, base64url
    public var tokenDigest: String        // 64 lowercase hex characters
}
```

### `Direction`

```swift
public enum Direction: UInt8 {
    case primaryToCompanion = 1
    case companionToPrimary = 2
    public var pathComponent: String      // "p2c" or "c2p"
    public var reversed: Direction
}
```

### `Link`

```swift
public actor Link {
    public init(credentials: Credentials, sends: Direction, transport: any RelayTransport,
                lastReceived: UInt64? = nil)
    public let credentials: Credentials
    public let sends: Direction
    public private(set) var lastReceived: UInt64?
    @discardableResult public func send(_ plaintext: Data, notify: Notify = .none) async throws -> UInt64
    public func receive() async throws -> [(sequence: UInt64, plaintext: Data)]
    public func erase() async throws
}
```

### `Relay`

```swift
public struct Relay: RelayTransport {
    public static let fetchLimit = 16
    public init(appID: String, credentials: Credentials, base: URL)
    public init(endpoint: URL, credentials: Credentials)   // full https://host/v1/<app id>/
    public static let keepAliveInterval: Duration          // 30 seconds
    public let endpoint: URL
    public func watch(direction: Direction) -> AsyncStream<UInt64>
    public func put(_ envelope: Data, direction: Direction, sequence: UInt64,
                    notify: Notify) async throws
    public func registerPush(_ registration: PushRegistration, direction: Direction) async throws
    public func unregisterPush(direction: Direction) async throws
    public func iceServers() async throws -> ICEConfiguration
    public func signal(sends direction: Direction) -> SignalChannel
    // RelayTransport methods below
}
```

### Extensions

```swift
public enum Notify: String { case none, alert, silent }

public struct PushRegistration {
    public init(service: String, fields: [String: String], tag: String, alert: String? = nil)
    public static func randomTag() -> String
    public var json: Data
}

public struct ICEConfiguration: Decodable { public let iceServers: [ICEServer]; public let ttl: Int }
public struct ICEServer: Decodable { public let urls: [String]; public let username, credential: String? }

public actor SignalChannel {
    public enum Event { case peer(Bool), message(Data) }
    public enum Failure: Error { case notConnected, closed(code: Int) }
    public func events() -> AsyncStream<Event>
    public func send(_ plaintext: Data) async throws
    public func close()
}

public enum SignalFrame {
    public static let maximumFrameBytes: Int          // 65_536
    public static let window: UInt64                  // 300_000 ms
    // seal / open, like Envelope, with a counter in place of the sequence
}

// ZeroBytePush
public enum APNsEnvironment: String { case production, development }
extension PushRegistration {
    public static func apns(deviceToken: Data, environment: APNsEnvironment, tag: String,
                            alert: String? = nil) -> PushRegistration
}
public enum ZeroBytePushPayload { public static func tag(in userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any]) -> String? }
```

`Relay` uses an ephemeral `URLSession` with no cookies, no cache and no credential store, a 30
second request timeout, and `waitsForConnectivity = false`, so a request without a network fails
fast instead of waiting.

### `RelayTransport`

```swift
public protocol RelayTransport: Sendable {
    func claim() async throws
    func put(_ envelope: Data, direction: Direction, sequence: UInt64) async throws
    func fetch(direction: Direction, after sequence: UInt64?) async throws
        -> (envelopes: [Data], more: Bool)
    func lastSequence(direction: Direction) async throws -> UInt64?
    func prune(direction: Direction, through sequence: UInt64) async throws
    func erase() async throws
}
```

### `Envelope` and `Wire`

```swift
public enum Envelope {
    public static let version: UInt8                  // 1
    public static let overhead: Int                   // 38
    public static let maximumPlaintextBytes: Int      // 1_048_576
    public static let maximumEnvelopeBytes: Int
    public static func seal(_ plaintext: Data, direction: Direction, sequence: UInt64,
                            credentials: Credentials) throws -> Data
    public static func open(_ envelope: Data, direction: Direction, after lastSequence: UInt64?,
                            credentials: Credentials) throws -> (sequence: UInt64, plaintext: Data)
    public static func header(of envelope: Data) throws -> (direction: Direction, sequence: UInt64)
}

public enum Wire {
    public static let maximumCount = 64
    public static func join(_ envelopes: [Data]) -> Data
    public static func split(_ data: Data) throws -> [Data]
}
```

### Errors

```swift
public enum ZeroByteError: Error {
    case invalidKey, malformedEnvelope, unsupportedVersion(UInt8), wrongDirection,
         replayed(sequence: UInt64), authenticationFailed, tooLarge
}

public enum RelayError: Error {
    case unauthorized, sequenceConflict(last: UInt64?), quotaExceeded,
         rateLimited(retryAfter: TimeInterval?), unavailable(status: Int), malformedResponse
}
```

## Testing

```sh
swift test
RELAY_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/ RELAY_APP=<app id> swift test   # also against a live relay
```

Set `RELAY_SIGNAL_APP` to an app with `signal` and `push=<topic>` to test the extensions too.

In your own tests, implement `RelayTransport` in memory and pass it to two `Link`s. See
[Testing your integration](../guides/testing.md).
