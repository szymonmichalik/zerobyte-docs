# Overview

ZeroByte is three things that share one specification:

1. **Relay Protocol v1**: how two devices derive keys from a shared secret, how they seal
   messages into envelopes, and the small HTTP API a relay offers.
2. **The relay**: a blind mailbox server. One file of protocol logic, run either as a Node server
   with one SQLite file or as a Cloudflare Worker with one Durable Object per mailbox. No
   dependencies.
3. **The SDKs**: Swift, Kotlin, JavaScript and .NET libraries that implement the client side. Each
   is tested against the same known-answer vectors.

## The problem it solves

A phone app with a desktop or watch companion needs to move data between them. The usual
options each cost something:

- A cloud backend with accounts sees every byte and becomes a liability.
- Peer-to-peer on the local network only works while both devices are on the same network and
  awake at the same time.
- Platform sync services tie you to one vendor and often to one platform.

ZeroByte sits between these. The relay is a store-and-forward mailbox, so the devices do not need
to be online together. Everything it stores is end-to-end encrypted under keys only the two
devices hold, so the relay operator learns nothing beyond traffic metadata. You can run the relay
yourself in a few minutes.

## How it fits together

```
 Primary device                       Relay                        Companion device
 ───────────────                      ─────                        ────────────────
 link key K, link id L                                             link key K, link id L
   │ HKDF                                                            │ HKDF
   ├─ mailbox id ───────────────▶  /v1/<app>/mailbox/<id>  ◀──────────┤ mailbox id
   ├─ bearer token ─────────────▶  stores SHA-256(token)   ◀──────────┤ bearer token
   ├─ p2c key (seal)                                                  ├─ p2c key (open)
   └─ c2p key (open)                                                  └─ c2p key (seal)

 send:  seal(p2c) ──PUT p2c/<seq>──▶  [ envelope ]  ──GET p2c?after──▶ open(p2c), then prune
 watch:                               WebSocket: "17" ─────────────▶ fetch now
```

1. **Pair.** Your app gives both devices the same 32-byte link key and 16-byte link id. ZeroByte
   does not take part in pairing and never sees the key. See [Pairing devices](../guides/pairing.md).
2. **Derive.** Each SDK derives, from the link key and link id, the mailbox id, the bearer token
   and one encryption key per direction.
3. **Send.** `Link.send` seals a message with ChaCha20-Poly1305, numbers it, and stores it in the
   mailbox.
4. **Receive.** The other device watches its direction over a WebSocket, fetches new envelopes,
   opens them and prunes what it has read from the relay.
5. **Unpair.** Either device erases the mailbox. A mailbox nobody writes to for 30 days erases
   itself.

## What ZeroByte is not

- **Not a sync engine.** It delivers opaque messages in order between exactly two devices. Merging
  state, resolving conflicts and choosing what to send are your app's job. See
  [Designing messages](../guides/message-design.md).
- **Not a backup.** Envelopes are deleted once read and the whole mailbox is deleted after 30 idle
  days. Nothing on the relay is meant to last.
- **Not group messaging.** A link connects two devices. A phone with three companions has three
  links.
- **Not anonymous.** The relay sees IP addresses while requests last, request times and envelope
  sizes. See [Security model](../SECURITY.md).
- **Not a pairing protocol.** You choose how the two devices agree the link key. The guide
  describes two sound ways.
