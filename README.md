# ZeroByte documentation

ZeroByte moves private data between two paired devices of one app. Every message is sealed on
the device that sends it. A relay files the sealed envelope under a mailbox and deletes it once
the other device has collected it. The relay never holds a key, so it cannot read, alter or
forge what it carries.

Use it for a phone and its companions: a laptop, a tablet, a watch, a browser tab, a desktop
app. The two devices agree a 32-byte link key once, when they pair. Every identifier and every
key is derived from it on the devices.

This repository is the developer documentation for the open protocol, the open-source relay and
the four SDKs. It covers everything you need to run your own relay and build on it.

A mirror of this documentation is published at [docs.zerobyte.cloud](https://docs.zerobyte.cloud).
This repository is the source; if the two differ, this repository is current.
