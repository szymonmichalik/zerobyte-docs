# Limits

| Limit | Value | Enforced by | Answer when exceeded |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plaintext | 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes) | Sender | `too_large` before sealing |
| Envelope | 38 B to 1 MiB + 38 B | Relay | `413` above, `400` below |
| Envelopes waiting per direction | 64 | Relay | `507` |
| Mailbox size, both directions | 32 MiB | Relay | `507` |
| Envelopes per fetch | 16 | Relay | Larger `limit` is reduced to 16 |
| Envelopes per wire body | 64 | Client | Body rejected as malformed |
| Sequence | 1 to 2^64 - 1 | Both | `404` for an invalid path segment |
| Idle mailbox | 30 days after the last write or claim | Relay | Mailbox erased |

## What counts toward the quotas

Only envelopes waiting to be read. Pruning frees both the slot and the bytes immediately. A
receiver that keeps up never comes close to either quota: the limits exist so that a link whose
other device has gone away for good cannot grow without bound.

## The idle timer

Every claim and every stored envelope restarts a 30-day timer. Fetching, pruning and watching do
not. When the timer fires, the relay erases the mailbox exactly as `DELETE /mailbox/<id>` would.

Consequences:

- A link where only one side writes stays alive as long as that side writes at least once every 30
  days.
- A link where nobody writes for 30 days loses its mailbox. Both devices still hold the link key,
  so the next request claims a fresh, empty mailbox under the same id and the link continues.
  Envelopes that were waiting when it expired are lost. `X-Relay-Last` starts again from nothing,
  so a sender continues from 1. A receiver holding a higher `last_received` would refuse those as
  replays. See [Link lifecycle](../guides/link-lifecycle.md) for how to handle this.

## Sizing your messages

With 64 slots and 32 MiB per mailbox, a direction can hold, for example, 64 messages of 512 KiB,
or 32 messages of 1 MiB before the mailbox total runs out. If your companion may be offline for
days while the primary keeps producing changes, coalesce changes into fewer, larger messages, or
send a "full state" message that supersedes older ones. See
[Designing messages](../guides/message-design.md).
